= Introduction

This assignment presented a mix of challenges and easier tasks, but this time,
we worked more collaboratively to complete it. Initially, we struggled with the
first task, which required a lot of time and effort. However, the second task
was simpler, as it involved replicating operations, such as division. The final
two exercises were more mechanicalâ€”once we understood the pattern, it was
straightforward to apply. Additionally, we used ChatGPT to help generate extra
test cases (the test which has a comment over them are AI generated) 
and refine the wording of the report. While it didn't write the
report for us, it was instrumental in making our text more concise.\
Following, I describe how to run the tests:

+ unzipping `a1-handout.zip`;
+ entering the `a1-handout` directory through the terminal;
+ running `cabal test` in the terminal.

Note that you can run `cabal --enable-coverage test` to see the coverage of
the codebase and you can also see what lines are not covered by the tests.

= Task - Function application

During the first task, we encountered several doubts, primarily revolving around
the design of the grammar and operator handling. These were the key issues,
ranked by difficulty:

+ Defining the grammar and determining the appropriate priority for each 
  operator;
+ Deciding on the precedence rules for the operators;
+ Implementing the parser itself, which posed a considerable challenge, though 
  slightly less complex than the earlier stages. 

Our Approach:

- We adopted a test-driven development (TDD) approach, allowing us to validate 
  our implementation step-by-step.
- Before diving into coding, we tried to structure the grammar as proposed in
  the Course Notes.

Finally, we managed to complete the task and the proposed test cases passed
successfully.

= Task - Equality and power operators

+ We renamed the `pExp<i>` parsers to `pExp<i+1>`;
+ We implemented the `pExp0` parser for handling the Equality operator;
+ We implemented the `pExp3` parser to handle the Power operator, ensuring it
  had a higher precedence than the basic arithmetic operators.

The `pExp3` parser drew inspiration from the pExp2 parser. We also modified
`pExp3` to properly handle right-associativity, as required for the new
precedence rule.

= Task - Printing, putting, and getting

- We faced some difficulty initially in determining where to insert the first
  parser into the grammar to ensure it worked correctly.

- We found that using the do notation made the code simpler and more readable
  compared to other styles. For example, compare the following implementations
  of the `pKvGetExp` parser:
  ```haskell
  pKvGetExp2 :: Parser Exp
  pKvGetExp2 = KvGet <$> (lKeyword "get" *> pAtom)

  -- vs. do notation

  pKvGetExp :: Parser Exp
  pKvGetExp = do
    lKeyword "get"
    KvGet <$> pAtom
  ```

= Task - Lambdas, let-binding and try-catch

The final task was quite mechanical compared to the previous ones. Once we
understood the patterns from earlier tasks, the implementation became
straightforward and repetitive in nature.\
Additionally, we note that by the definition of a lambda in our implementation,
it can only take one argument, while in Haskell, a lambda can take as many
arguments as needed.

#ask()[
Why might or might it not be problematic for your implementation that the 
grammar has operators `*` and `**` where one is a prefix of the other?
]

Since we are using `lString` to parse both the `*` and `**` operators, the only
feasible solution is to parse the `**` operator first. Otherwise, any occurrence
of `**` would be incorrectly parsed as a `*` operator followed by another `*`. 
This issue arises because the `*` operator is a prefix of the `**` operator.

One possible solution to this problem would be to use `lKeyword` for parsing 
both `*` and `**`. However, this would impose a restriction where the language 
would no longer recognize expressions like `4*2` without spaces, and instead, it 
would only accept `4 * 2`.
